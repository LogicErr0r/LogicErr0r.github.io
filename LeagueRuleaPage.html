      <h2 >What is Brawl?</h2>
      <p>Brawl is a 1v1 singleton format where a deck is restricted to the color identity of its commander, a legendary creature OR a 
        legendary planeswalker. There is no sideboard, players start with 25 life, and there is one free mulligan. Whenever a commander 
        dies or would be put into exile, a player can choose to return it to the command zone instead, and a tax of two colorless mana is 
        applied cumulatively toward the next time it would be cast. Brawl through the MTG arena queue is intended as a casual format. 
        Instead of bans and balances, a matchmaking algorithm is used to segregate commanders by relative power level.</p>

      <h2>What is League?</h2>
      <p>The Brawl Hub league takes the casual Brawl format and turns it into a competitive format. In order to keep the format 
        competitive, the league uses a custom banlist reviewed each season, Bo3 matches, and pairings based on player performance. Sign-up 
        to play, read the community-maintained banlist, submit a decklist, and receive weekly Bo3 matchups versus three different 
        opponents from around the world. You have one week to schedule and play your matchups at your own convenience. Do well, and you 
        will face more challenging opponents. End the season in the top eight and you will receive an invitation to the once-a-month 
        double-elimination tournament. Conquer the tournament, and your name and deck list will be inducted to the hall of fame.</p>
